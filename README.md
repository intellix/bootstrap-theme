# Bootstrap theme starting point

Starting point and build process for creating bootstrap themes with SASS.

Rather than styling individual pages from a PSD and duplicating styling, you create a theme and depend on it via bower within multiple projects.

```bash
npm install
bower install
gulp serve # watch and rebuild
gulp # build
```
